      "The Twelve Months",
      [
      `
      An awful woman lived with her daughter and stepdaughter in her household. She possessed feelings of hate for her stepdaughter, Anna. Anna worked while her stepsister did nothing. On a cold january night, 
      Anna's stepmother remarked, "Your stempsister desires flowers. Go and find some."
      `,
      `
      Anna wasn't anxious to walk through the chilled landscale. The cold air made her lungs burn. She walked at a slow pace bacause of the snow. Soon she saw a group of the man said they were
      the twelve months and that they would help Anna. January walked to her and made a motion with his hand. The days of the moth passed rapidly until it was February's turn. February also made the 
      month speed up. Then March made the sun shine and flowers grew in the field.
      `,
      `
      Anna loaded her basket with so many flowers that she could hardly lift it. Then she gave a quick but polite "thank you" to the twelve men and returned home. 
      She was very eager to show her stepmother all the flowers. Back at the house, she spilled the flowers onto the table. Then she told her stepmother about the twelve men.
      Anna's stepmother and stepsister went to seek the twelve months. their intent was to ask for gifts. They looked and looked. They became very lost and never found their way home. 
      Anna lived happily by herself.
